- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alexr2391 32 years old and am a self taught developer, mainly focusing on Javascript stacks for the moment. 

I have a Managment background but the last 3 years my passion for new technologies have taken the upper hand 
and so I decided to start focusing on learning programming. I always had the curiosity to undestand how websites work so I naturally started with HTML and CSS 
then after 3 months I quickly jumped over to javascript which changed everything for me. 

Since then I focused on learning all the fundamental concepts (variable scope, data types, 
hoisting etc...) then I moved on more elaborated concepts as OOP and Design patterns as well as keeping up with ES9 syntax. As my knowledge and
undestanding of the language developped, I grew more confident in expanding my skills in some backend with Node.js / Mongo / PostGre but also front end
framewoeks such as React.js! 

I am currently working as E-commerce Manager in Greece and since the beginning the project had various needs for 
static content delivery as well as small development projects, so I had the amazing opportunity to put my technical knowledge into use by developping 
many static content on the CMS platform, such as information pages, landing pages but also small apps with Node.js 
(booking app for customer Click Away services during Covid, recruitment platform). 

Now I am looking forward to convert myself into becomming a Full-time programmer and taking on new challenges. 

- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Nexts.js, MongoDB, PostGres
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js, Typescript 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mainly on Web apps, Front-end React.js projects but I am open for more.

I love learning new stuff and try new thing, currently I am focusing on learning NEXT.js and Typescript.
